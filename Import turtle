Plotting using Turtle

To make use of the turtle methods and functionalities, we need to import turtle.”turtle” comes packed with the standard Python package and need not be installed externally. The roadmap for executing a turtle program follows 4 steps:  

Import the turtle module
Create a turtle to control.
Draw around using the turtle methods.
Run turtle.done().
So as stated above, before we can use turtle, we need to import it. We import it as : 
from turtle import *

# or

import turtle

After importing the turtle library and making all the turtle functionalities available to us, we need to create a new drawing board(window) and a turtle. Let’s call the window as wn and the turtle as skk. So we code as: 

wn = turtle.Screen()

wn.bgcolor("light green")

wn.title("Turtle")

skk = turtle.Turtle()

Now that we have created the window and the turtle, we need to move the turtle. To move forward 100 pixels in the direction skk is facing, we code: 

skk.forward(100)

We have moved skk 100 pixels forward, Awesome! Now we complete the program with the done() function and We’re done! 

turtle.done()

So, we have created a program that draws a line 100 pixels long. We can draw various shapes and fill different colors using turtle methods. There’s plethora of functions and programs to be coded using the turtle library in python. Let’s learn to draw some of the basic shapes. 

 

Shape 1: Square
# Python program to draw square 

# using Turtle Programming

import turtle 

skk = turtle.Turtle()

 

for i in range(4):

    skk.forward(50)

    skk.right(90)

     

turtle.done()

Shape 2: Star

# Python program to draw star
# using Turtle Programming

import turtle

star = turtle.Turtle()
 

star.right(75)

star.forward(100)
 

for i in range(4):

    star.right(144)

    star.forward(100)

     
turtle.done()
